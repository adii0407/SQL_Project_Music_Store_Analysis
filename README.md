Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. 
For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount. 
## Conclusion

- The store can consider shutting the non-performing regions as it has a very low customer base. Instead of spreading itself thin, it can concentrate on pushing sales in USA and Canada which already has a good rapport with the customers as it gets lot of repeat sales from a single customer.

- The store should also look at developing Brazil Market as it has got customers who are ready to spend in the store as well as give repeat business.

- We can see the popular genre and artist in the various regions and can look to run promotions or offers, like inviting the artist who sold the most albums or run a promotion to win tickets for concert etc to attract more customers.

- Pulling out from non-performing markets may give the store resource to do more advertisement in the popular region. This will in long run, build customer base and thereby push up profits.
